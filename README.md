## Instructions

### What to build

You are building a minimal weather app.

At a minimum the app should have a single button. Pressing this button should call a [firebase cloud function](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).
The firebase function is already implemented, you only need to call this from the app.

After clicking the button, the app should show the current temperature in London.

Any packages you choose to add will need to be motivated, make sure to include strong reasoning for why you chose to add any third party library.

### Example
Here is an example of how the App could look: [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/wZ16lZpnhJmgYh3LJ0AihI/Interview-Task?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2). Some assets are included in `/app/assets/weather-images/`.

### Advanced
Feel free to expand on the app's functionality and design, as long as you meet the MVP requirements shown in the prototype in the example section.
Show us what you can do.


### ðŸš€ How to run
- Create a firebase project (donâ€™t worry, it is free) [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Install the firebase [cli](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
- Log in to your google account you created the project with using `firebase login`
- Run `firebase projects:list`
- Copy the `project-id` of the project you created.
- Run `firebase use --add project-id`
- Go to `app/firebase.js` and change the `firebaseConfig` to that of the firebase project you just created. You can find this in the project settings in the Firebase console.
- To start the app, run `npm install`, `npm run ios` or `npm run android` from the `/app` folder
- To start the local emulator, run `npm install`, `npm run serve` from the `/functions` folder
